# Context
Global Game Jam 2016

# Synopsis
You play the role of a Necromaestro leading a band of skeletons. You control the game using your smartphone pointed at a secret web location. Communication with the server is done using sockets and Unity is used as a playback engine to show the state of the game on the server and play music and sounds generated by the players attempting to complete the sacred ritual.

# Outcome
We won for Best Party Game! :)
