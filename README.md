Global Game Jam 2016

# Synopsis
You play the role of a Necromaestro leading a band of skeletons. You control the game using your smartphone pointed at a secret web location. Communication is done using sockets and the Unity is used to show the state of the game at all times and play the music generated by the players attempting to complete the sacred ritual.
